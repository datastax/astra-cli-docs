:navtitle: Upgrade from pre-1.0 versions

{product} 1.0 and later do not support xref:ROOT:upgrade.adoc[in-place upgrades] from versions earlier than 1.0.

If you have an earlier version installed, you must delete the `astra` executable before you can install the latest version:

[tabs,sync-group-id=platforms]
======
macOS and Linux::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
rm ~/.astra/cli/astra
----
--

Homebrew::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
brew uninstall datastax/astra-cli/astra-cli
----
--
======

After removing the previous version, follow the instructions in xref:ROOT:install.adoc[] to install the latest version.

The new version uses your existing xref:ROOT:manage-cli.adoc#file-locations[home directory and configuration file], unless you delete them.
